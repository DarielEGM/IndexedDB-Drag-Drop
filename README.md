This project was built with JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

The goal of the app is to create a database in the browser, if it doesn't already exist, and add names via the text box. For the names already entered, it can be rewritten, since these are editable, and also deleted from the database.

## ✨**Main View**✨

Here is an example of what the app looks like when it runs.
